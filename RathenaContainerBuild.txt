First we open a terminal on the folder designated, then we run the following command to start a container with the current folder mounted as a volume:
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/work" \
  -w /work \
  marketplace.gcr.io/google/debian12:latest \
  bash

Then we install the necessary dependencies:
apt update
apt install -y build-essential git
apt install zlib1g-dev
apt install libmariadb-dev 
apt install libmariadbclient-dev-compat


Then we clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/TsunaHalo2001/rathena-tests.git

Then we navigate to the folder and run the build script:
cd rathena-tests
make clean
make server
