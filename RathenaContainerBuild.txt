First we open a terminal on the folder designated, then we run the following command to start a container with the current folder mounted as a volume:
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/work" \
  -w /work \
  marketplace.gcr.io/google/debian12:latest \
  bash

Then we install the necessary dependencies:
apt update
apt install -y build-essential git
apt install zlib1g-dev
apt install libmariadb-dev 
apt install libmariadbclient-dev-compat


Then we clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/TsunaHalo2001/rathena-tests.git

Then we navigate to the folder and run the build script:
cd rathena-tests
make clean
make server

After the build, compress the server folder into a tar.gz file and upload to releases on GitHub
Then we can exit the container:
exit

Next we enter to GCloud console:
gcloud compute ssh ro-server

Next enter on root:
sudo -i

Then we navigate to the folder previous to rathena-tests:
cd /home/joan01benyamin/home/user/

Then we download the tar.gz file from GitHub releases:
wget https://github.com/TsunaHalo2001/rathena-tests/releases/download/[RELEASE_VERSION]/rathena-tests.tar.gz

Then we extract the tar.gz file:
tar -xvzf rathena-tests.tar.gz

Then we navigate to the rathena-tests folder:
cd rathena-tests

Then we reload all the binaries executed from each Screen session:
screen -r login
screen -r char
screen -r map
screen -r web

We Ctrl+C on each session to stop the server, then we run the new binaries:
./login-server
./char-server
./map-server
./web-server

Then we Ctrl+A then D to detach from each session.

Finally we return to user folder and delete the tar.gz file:
cd /home/joan01benyamin/home/user/
rm rathena-tests.tar.gz
